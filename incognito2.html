    <div class="description">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Generative adversarial networks offer new ways of
      visual research. My algorithmic self is an ongoing research into
      digital identity in the age of surveillance capitalism [1]. Trough
      back and forth visual conversation, self-expression and creative
      collaboration with the neural network, my algorithmic self is
      ever-changing.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp; We use our face on digital media platforms in order to
      represent ourselves in the online world, a world often described as
      the cloud, a name that represents something that we can actually
      conceive, while in reality the internet can not just be seen by
      looking at the sky. Cables placed deep in the ocean and data-centers
      hidden in big boxes hide the control over its users both in online
      as well as the offline world. We often fail to understand the
      consequences and costs of being an online entity. Living online
      means to be seen, and to be seen is to be recognized, to be
      recognized is to be analyzed and to be analyzed is to be reduced to
      information. Information that is used to govern our lives, not only
      online, but also in offline public spaces by fueling facial
      recognition algorithms.
      <br /><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we could actually see this happening for
      ourselves, for a lot of people including myself, there remains a
      desire to be included online. A fear of missing out controls the
      desire to remain visible and to not go unnoticed. This creates a
      contradiction. We want to remain visible, but we also do not want to
      be controlled. In the online world to remain visible means to be
      controlled.
      <br /><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;My algorithmic self acts as a proposed way to deal with
      this contradiction, and is as a protest of the constant governing
      of the digital - and with that - the physical body. It can’t be
      tracked, governed, controlled or nudged, as is not a human being,
      but just a reflection of one. It doesn’t browse the internet, rather
      it lives inside the browser. It surfs the transatlantic
      communication cables, flies trough disk space, and chills in the
      clouds, unnoticed by its algorithmic brothers and sisters that where
      born to control. My algorithmic self runs in constant feedback loop,
      it learns from experiences as it grows older, in search for a new
      identity. My algorithmic self takes away my fear of missing out, it
      allows me to go unnoticed and noticed at the same time trough the
      means of my new digital body.
