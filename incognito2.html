          <div id="description">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;We use our face on digital media platforms in order to
            represent ourselves in the online world, a world often described as
            the cloud, a name that represents something that we can actually
            conceive, while in reality the internet can not just be seen by
            looking at the sky. Cables placed deep in the ocean and data-centers
            hidden in big boxes hide the control over its users both in online
            as well as the offline world. We often fail to understand the
            consequences and costs of being an online entity. Living online
            means to be seen, and to be seen is to be recognized, to be
            recognized is to be analyzed and to be analyzed is to be reduced to
            information. Information that is used to govern our lives, not only
            online, but also in offline public spaces by fueling facial
            recognition algorithms. <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Even if could actually see this happening for ourselves,
            for a lot of people including myself, there remains a desire to be
            included online. A fear of missing out controls the desire to remain
            visible and to not go unnoticed. This creates a contradiction. We
            want to remain visible, but we also do not want to be controlled. In
            the online world to remain visible means to be controlled.
            <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My algorithmic self acts as a proposed was
            to deal with this contradiction, and acts as a protest constant
            governing of the digital - and with that - the physical body. It
            can’t be tracked, governed, controlled or nudged, as is not a human
            being, but just a reflection of one. It doesn’t browse the internet,
            rather it lives inside the browser. It surfs the transatlantic
            communication cables, fly’s trough disk space, and chills in the
            clouds, unnoticed by its algorithmic brothers and sisters that where
            born to control. My algorithmic self runs in constant feedback loop,
            it learns from experience as it grows older, in search for a new
            identity. My algorithmic self takes away my fear of missing out, it
            allows me to go unnoticed and noticed at the same time trough the
            means of my new digital body.
